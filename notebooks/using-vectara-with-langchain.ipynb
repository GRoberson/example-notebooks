    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a Vectara account to use Vectara with LangChain. To get started, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. [Sign up](https://www.vectara.com/integrations/langchain) for a Vectara account if you don't already have one. Once you have completed your sign up you will have a Vectara customer ID. You can find your customer ID by clicking on your name, on the top-right of the Vectara console window.\n",
    "2. Within your account you can create one or more corpora. Each corpus represents an area that stores text data upon ingest from input documents. To create a corpus, use the **\"Create Corpus\"** button. You then provide a name to your corpus as well as a description. Optionally you can define filtering attributes and apply some advanced options. If you click on your created corpus, you can see its name and corpus ID right on the top.\n",
    "3. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the corpus. Click on the **\"Access Control\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name, and choose whether you want query only or query+index for your key. Click \"Create\" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use LangChain with Vectara, you'll need to provide your `customer ID`, `corpus ID` and an `api_key` to the LangChain Vectara class. You can do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include in your environment these three variables: `VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID`, `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID` and `VECTARA_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, you can set these variables using `os.environ` as follows (this points to one to a public Vectara corpus where the contents of vectara.com are indexed):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "customer_id = '1366999410'\n",

    "os.environ[\"VECTARA_API_KEY\"] = api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add them explicitly to the Vectara constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vectorstore = Vectara(\n",
